These are the steps for installing Python on your Windows computer. Please go to the Mac installations if you are using a Mac.

## Visual Studio Code Extensions

Install these extensions to get your VS Code editor set up for writing Python code.

* [Pylance][1]
* [Python Extension Pack][2]
* [SQLite][3]
* [Python Test Explorer][4]
* [Python Docstring Generator][5]

## Python
Python is not included with Windows. You must go to the [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page, download version 3.9, and install it. It will be installed in the `C:\Python39` directory.

After installing it, you must add `C:\Python39` to your system path. Here's how:

1. Press your Windows key.
2. Begin by typing **Control**.
3. The Windows Control Panel should be the first result in the search results. Click on it.
4. When the control panel screen appears, begin typing `environment` in the upper right corner search bar.
5. Choose the option to modify environmental variables. If you are given two options, you may select either one.
6. When the screen appears, click the Environment Variables button at the bottom.
7. Next, select on the `PATH` variable and click the Edit button.
8. Enter a semicolon and the new path entry at the end of the string. `;C:\Python39`

### Install Pipenv

This tool will manage any libraries that are needed for each of your projects. It creates a "container" or virtual environment to add the different libraries to the current project.

In some ways, `pipenv` does the same thing as `node_modules` and `package.json`. It tells the program what libraries it needs (`package.json` vs. `Pipfile`) and stores those libraries for use within the project (`node_modules`). You‚Äôll learn more about this as we use it in later projects.

1. Install the package globally:

    ```sh
    python3 -m pip install pipenv
    ```

1. Close your terminal app and then reopen the terminal
1. Check that the package is usable: `pipenv --version` should output a version of pipenv. Something like: `pipenv, version 2022.9.24`
1. **If you get a message saying `command pipenv not found`, reach out to an instructor now.**
