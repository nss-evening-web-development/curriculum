I introduce to you, **Koans** — a test driven way to understand the language syntax and available data structures.

It's best to take your time and make sure you understand each section before progressing. Just making the test pass doesn't mean you learned the lesson.

If you reach a section that we haven't covered, feel free to do some preliminary research until class covers that concept.

## Instructions

Here is the button/link to the repo:

The instructions on how to run through this is in the README.md. Just don't worry about the installing Sniffer part.

***DISCLAIMER: This repo will be forked and not copied, so make sure any pull reuquests you make are actually to your repo and not the original one!***

Have fun reaching enlightenment!
