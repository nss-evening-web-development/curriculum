            ### Supporting 3rd Party Software

            Now you are going to install two tools:

            1. **autopep8** - This is an auto formatter that follows the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. This will be installed globally, so you won't have to install this again.
                * Run: `python3 -m pip install autopep8`
            3. **pylint** - This is a linter that shows any lint errors in your code. This will be installed locally within the pipenv environment (more on this later). For every new project you'll need to install pylint into each one.
                * Run: `pipenv install pylint`

            Then, start a virtual environment. Virtual environments ensure that libraries installed for a project don't pollute the entire operating system. It keeps everything contained to the project.

                ```sh
                pipenv shell
                ```

            ```

            ```markdown
            Adjust VS Code Settings
            First you'll need to select the correct Python Interpreter. Open the command palette with `cmd+shift+p` and select "Python: Select Interpretor". Find the option that has `<your folder name>-<random string>`

            Open the command palette again and search for "Open Settings (JSON)"
            Add these to the bottom of the file, updating the autopep8Path to be the output of `which autopep8`

                ```
                "python.formatting.autopep8Path": "paste in the output from the which command",
                "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
                ```

            With pylint enabled we need to control some of the warnings that VS Code will warn about. We can do this by creating a `.pylintrc` file. Copy this command into the terminal to create the file:
                ```
                echo '[FORMAT]
                good-names=i,
                    j,
                    ex,
                    pk,
                    id,
                    do_PUT,
                    do_POST,
                    do_OPTIONS,
                    do_GET,
                    do_DELETE

                [MESSAGES CONTROL]
                disable=broad-except,redefined-builtin,missing-module-docstring
                ' > .pylintrc
                ```
            ```

            If you press `opt-shift-f` while the `request_handler.py` file is active, some code should change to conform to PEP 8 standards
