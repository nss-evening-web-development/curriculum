Watch a short video to learn how to [configure Visual Studio Code to debug Python files](https://youtu.be/scAOUwa9XvM).

Here's a short animation showing you a breakpoint being set in the code, and then inspecting the value of the `all_students` variable in both the variables panel and in a pop-up window in the editor.

Your instruction team will also show you how to use the debugger with Python in class.
