Sign up for a free [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/i) account using the GitHub account you just created.

There will be times when you will not want to do the setup to run code locally on your machine. You may use GitPod as it will give you the environment setup you need to be successful. A free plan should be enough for this course, but if want to do more, you may want to consider a paid plan.

Once you have completed all the steps above, push the button below to close this page and check the box on the list to mark as completed.
