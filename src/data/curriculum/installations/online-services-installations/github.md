GitHub is a site that software developers throughout the world use to store their code, and share it with other developers. [Visit the sign up page](https://github.com/join) and create your own, free account.

1. **Select a username.** For almost all students we suggest just going with some version of your first and last name.
1. **Add a photo of your face** - NOT your cat, dog, dinosaur, or BFF. Your real face...semi recently.

**NOTE: When creating your GitHub account, be mindful of the fact that potential employers will be viewing your profile when you apply for jobs, so keep it professional.**

Once you have completed all the steps above, push the button below to close this page and check the box on the list to mark as completed.
