Git is a way for you to keep track of changes to files while you are developing. You will get into the purpose when you begin using the tool. For now, we need to install it on your machine.

Run the following commands in the terminal:

```shell
brew install git
```

After that install finishes, run...

```shell
brew install tig
```

Once you have completed all the steps above, push the button below to close this page and check the box on the list to mark as completed.
