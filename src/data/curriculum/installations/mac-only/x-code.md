Since you are going to be learning how to be a professional software developer, you will be using your computer terminal heavily. Mac users need to install some baseline tools to use more advanced things later in the course.

Run the following command in the terminal to install Command Line Tools **AND WAIT a while**:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Once you have completed all the steps above, push the button below to close this page and check the box on the list to mark as completed.
