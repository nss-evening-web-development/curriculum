In the next few lessons, you will work through setting up your machine for local development.

Keep in mind that these lessons assume that your [machine meets all the hardware requirements](https://learn.nashvillesoftwareschool.com/blog/2022/01/14/hardware-requirements-web-development-bootcamps-at-nss). If your machine does not meet the requirements, you will not be successful in this program.

### How this works
You will have to complete each lesson for each computer type to ensure that you install in the order needed.

### 👀 Keep in mind:
Do not skip lessons as some of the installs build on top of the other. The way the course is designed, you have to confirm installation before moving on to the next item on the list.

### Final note:
We cannot tell you how excited we are to have you start your journey! Let's get it done!
