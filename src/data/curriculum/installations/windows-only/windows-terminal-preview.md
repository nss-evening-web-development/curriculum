Visit the [Windows Terminal Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3?cid=msft_web_chart&activetab=pivot:overviewtab) download page and open it in the Microsoft Store App. This will be your default terminal which you will use to navigate your file system, and run development tools.

Once Windows Terminal Preview is installed:

- Go to the Start menu (Windows key)
- Search for Windows Terminal Preview
- Open Windows Terminal Preview
- By default, this will open a new PowerShell terminal window. Do not use the PowerShell terminal window.
- Click the down arrow ﹀ located at the top of the terminal window.
- Select Git Bash from the dropdown menu to start a new Git Bash terminal window.

**NOTE: Always use Git Bash, not PowerShell.**
