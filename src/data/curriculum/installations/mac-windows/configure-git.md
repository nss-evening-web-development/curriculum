**NOTE: This step requires your GitHub username and email, which you should have created earlier. You will need the email address you used for the GitHub account you created.**

Watch the video below on how to set up global Git configuration using your GitHub username and the email address associated with your GitHub account. This will allow you to successfully back up your code to GitHub.

Add Global User

```

Add the email you used for Github

```
