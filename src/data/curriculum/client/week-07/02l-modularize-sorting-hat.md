**Objective:** Students will understand and implement code modules in separate files using import and export statements. 

## Overview:
Modules allow us to organize our code. A module can contain variables and functions. A module is nothing more than a chunk of JavaScript code written in a file. By default, variables and functions of a module are not available for use until they are exported/imported.

## IN CLASS
Walk through modularizing a few code blocks in the sorting hat project. Allow students to complete the rest of the modularization in the lab.
