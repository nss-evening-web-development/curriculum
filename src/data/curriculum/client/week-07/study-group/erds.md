In this lesson, you are going to use, discuss, and learn how to create your first Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). An ERD is a vital tool for software developers so that the data and the relationships between them can be visualized.

You will touch more on this in backend, but we will be using data for our applications so it is important that we understand how we will need to format the data in order to be able to manipulate it.

## Learning Objectives
- You should be able to explain the purpose of an ERD.
- You should be able to identify resources, fields, primary keys, and foreign keys on an ERD.
- You should be able to define resources, their fields, and their relationships in dbdiagram.
- You should be able to explain what a 1 -> many relationship is.
