From this point forward until we get to React, we will be using Webpack to help compile and run our code.

This will prepare you for working with React and get you accustomed to the linters and code style standards for class, which are really strict.

You will learn that there are some very picky settings. This will make you a better engineer in the long term and keep your code clean.

Webpack is a task runner and a module bundler. It originally started as a module bundler. This means that it takes all of your separate Javascript modules and bundles them together into a single file. Webpack also automates some of the tasks that we have to run every time we change the code. It will automate these tasks so that we are not typing in the same commands every single time.

## IN CLASS
We will walk through the <a href="https://github.com/codetracker-learning/LAB-error-clean-up" target="_blank">webpack readme</a> allowing students to ask questions and get acclimated with the lay of the land.
