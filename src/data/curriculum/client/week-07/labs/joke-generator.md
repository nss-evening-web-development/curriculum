## Starting the Project
1. Go to the assignment and use the provided repo to start this project. Name the project "Joke Generator"
1. Follow all the instructions for setup in the template README.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. When a user first loads the app, a button appears on the DOM that reads "Get a Joke"
1. When the user presses the "Get a Joke" button, an API call is made to the joke API and the joke setup appears on the DOM.
1. When a user presses the "Get a Joke" button, the button text changes to "Get Punchline"
1. When a user presses the "Get Punchline" button, both the joke setup and delivery are on the DOM along with a button that reads "Get Another Joke"
1. When the user presses the "Get Another Joke" button, the app starts over from step 3.
