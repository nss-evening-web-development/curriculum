Using the same repo that you working on for the Stop the Blood Lab:

- move the student data into utils/data (studentArray, voldysArmy array, any functions that update these arrays)
- Move any other data out like the houses, etc.
- do the exports and imports as needed
- Focus on ONE of the visual elements. These go in the components directory
- **Extra Challenge:** `npm install uuid` Use instead of the createId method
