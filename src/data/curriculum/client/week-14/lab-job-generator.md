## Project Deets
You will be creating a Joke Generator!

This project is meant to get you thinking in React and to help you with some concepts.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- When a user first loads the app, a button appears on the DOM that reads "Get a Joke"
- When the user presses the "Get a Joke" button, an API call is made to the joke API and the joke setup appears on the DOM.
- When a user presses the "Get a Joke" button, the button text changes to "Get Punchline"
- When a user presses the "Get Punchline" button, both the joke setup and delivery are on the DOM along with a button that reads "Get Another Joke"
- When the user presses the "Get Another Joke" button, the app starts over from step 3.
