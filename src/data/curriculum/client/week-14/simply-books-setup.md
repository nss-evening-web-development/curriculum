### Description
For this project we are making the following assumptions:

- Users can only CRUD on items they created (this includes filtered data like favorites)
- an author can have many books
- a book can have one and only one author

In this project, you will be touching on the all of the following concepts that you learned in prework and building your first React App:

- Google Authentication with Firebase
- User specific data
- React basics and working with components
- State and working with events
- Rendering lists and conditional content (READ)
- Props
- Hooks
   - useState (State)
   - useEffect
- Routing (including dynamic routing)
   - Links & Navigation
- Forms (CREATE/UPDATE)
   - Two-way binding (listening to changes in input as well as the value)

**_All CRUD concepts touched in topics above_**
