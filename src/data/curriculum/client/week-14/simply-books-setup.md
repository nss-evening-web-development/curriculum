### Description
For this project we are making the following assumptions:

- Users can only CRUD on items they created (this includes filtered data like favorites)
- an author can have many books
- a book can have one and only one author

In this project, you will be touching on the all of the following concepts that you learned in prework and building your first React App:

- Google Authentication with Firebase
- User specific data
- React basics and working with components
- State and working with events
- Rendering lists and conditional content (READ)
- Props
- Hooks
   - useState (State)
   - useEffect
- Routing (including dynamic routing)
   - Links & Navigation
- Forms (CREATE/UPDATE)
   - Two-way binding (listening to changes in input as well as the value)

**_All CRUD concepts touched in topics above_**

## Project
In this project, we want to get acclimated with the project template. Below is a list of the items that you should complete prior to beginning the project:

### 1. Google Authentication with Firebase
- Complete "Starting the Project" on the Repo README
- Relevant files:
   - .env (Add firebase credentials to .env file)
      - Note that the env vars in Next.js require the prefix **`NEXT_PUBLIC_`** before the name to be accessed in your code
   - `utils/client.js`
   - `utils/auth.js`


### 2. Folder based routes ([Routing Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing))

Remember: 
- In the `src/app` directory, create a new folder named the path specified.(e.g. contact.js)
- You may have nested routes by creating directories/folders

Create the following new folder based routes and add filler code **(IMPORTANT: make sure ALL of the functions names start with a capital letter)**
   - `src/app/authors/page.js`
   - `src/app/profile/page.js`
   - `src/app/author/new/page.js`


### 3. DYNAMIC routes ([Routing Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes))

Remember: 
- DYNAMIC routes are determined by naming a folder with square brackets and then the name of the dynamic key - between: [dynamicKey]‚Äô
- The folder name MUST have square brackets if the route is using a dynamic route
- You can only have one dynamic folder per directory level
- You can name the dynamic key ANYTHING. It is a taco.

Create the following new folder based DYNAMIC routes **(IMPORTANT: make sure ALL of the functions names start with a capital letter)**
- `src/app/author/[firebaseKey]/page.js`
- `src/app/author/edit/[firebaseKey]/page.js`

### 4. [Links & Navigation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link)

- Update the `NavBar.js` component to include the following links. Link the pages to the relevant pages you created in the routing activity
   - Authors
   - Create Author
   - Profile

### 5. [Extracting Dynamic Route Data](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes)
- Now that you have some pages/routes set up, let's grab the data from the dynamic routes.
- The actual value for *DYNAMIC_KEY* is whatever you named your file. In this instance it is **firebaseKey**, so make sure to update the code below inside of your component

```js

export default function PageName({ params }) {
    // inside component use
    const { DYNAMIC_KEY } = params;
}

```

### 6. Working with components
- **Create User component:** a component that accepts the user object and uses the image, name, email, and last login
    - For any images be sure to use the `<img/>` tag instead of the `<Image/>` component from Next/Image.
    - An eslint error: **Do not use <img>. Use Image from 'next/image' instead. See [https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element.](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element)** Just disable this error for the entire file.
    
    - If you do use Next/Image component you will need to add your image domain in to the `config.next.js` file. 
        - ```images: { domains: ['lh3.googleusercontent.com'], },```
        - Next/Image also requires the `width` & `height` props.
- **Create AuthorCard component:** a component that accepts the author data and displays it.
- Setup PropTypes and use default props to give default values to the component so you can test it


### 7. User specific data

- Relevant files
   - `utils/context/authContext.js`
- useAuth custom hook
   - Use the following code anywhere inside your components to get access to the user details

```js
const { user } = useAuth();
```

- In the `src/app/profile/page.js` file, use the **User component** you created to display the user information.
- Add the Sign Out button below the user component
- Use the code above inside of your component to get access to the useAuth hook **_(Make sure to import the dependency located in `utils/context/authContext.js`)_**

### 8. Bring over the data

Go to your old Almost Amazon project and bring copy/paste the author, books and merged data API calls you created into the relevant files. **DO NOT OVERWRITE ANY FUNCTIONS** that currently are in those files unless yours are different.
