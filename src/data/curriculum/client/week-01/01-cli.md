### Introduction
The command line is a text based interface that allows you to control your computer. You can use it to navigate your machine’s file structure and perform commands that you can't using just your computers file explorer. Becoming comfortable with your terminal will make you a master of the computer.

### Tools
- Mac Users: You will be using an application called [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac)
- Windows Users: You will be using [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701)
- OPTIONAL (Mac and Windows): [VSCode Integrated Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)
No matter if you use the terminal applications on your computer or the integrated terminal, commands will run the same.
