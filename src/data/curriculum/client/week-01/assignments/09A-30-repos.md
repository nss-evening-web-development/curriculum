Now is your time to do what you learned in the videos! You will be creating repos on github and connecting them to your local directories.

You WILL make mistakes! That is OK because that means you are learning. The outcome of making all of these repos will be that you will get accustomed to creating the connections on GitHub so that we can build!

### Create 30 repos (test1-test30).
- Each of these repos should live here: ~/workspace/foundations/exercises.
- **DO NOT DO ALL REPOS ON THE SAME DAY.** Create a maximum of 5 repos per day.
- Each repo should have:
  - Each repo should have a setup branch. This branch should have 3 files - `index.html`, `main.css`, and `main.js`. The index.html file should have html boilerplate, link to the CSS file, script tag to the JS file. The css file should change the background color. The JS file should have a console.log of your choice
  - There should be PR from the setup branch to the main branch
  - Before you merge the PR - your code should be properly indented and clean (consistent appropriate spacing)
  - Final result for a repo should have everything merged into main
  - If you mess up on one, skip it and move on, adding to your final number of completed repos. i.e. if you mess up test05, move on to test06, and at the end of this end up with test01-test31 pushed up to GitHub, skipping test05 (the one you messed up)
