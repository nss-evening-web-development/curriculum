### 📝 Assignment 1: Git Version
Let's make sure your computer is up-to-date with a modern version. Open your terminal. Run the following command.

```
git --version
```

You should see something like the following:

```
git version 2.29.2
```

Any version greater than 2.27 is sufficient. If you have a lesser version, you will need to upgrade. If you need to upgrade git, [click here](https://nss-evening-curriculum.netlify.app/client/upgrade-git).

```
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```
