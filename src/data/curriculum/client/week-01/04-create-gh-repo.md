Now that you are familiar with basic commands in the terminal, we will look at how to connect our local repos with the remote repos on Github.

In this video, we walk you through how to create a directory and make the connection. This may seem foreign at first, but you will be using this throughout your time at NSS, so it will become second nature.

Follow the motions and the video and know that eventually, it will all make sense.

### Remember to: Trust the process
