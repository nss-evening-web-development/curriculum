FIRST, let us acknowledge that this may seem like a lot to learn, but you will do this so many times, it will become second nature to you...remember to **TRUST THE PROCESS.** We gotchu, fam!

When you are working on assignments and teams, you will sometimes need to clone a repo so that you can get to work. **You will only clone a repo if there is already code on GitHub that you do not already have on your local machine.**

In this lesson, we will be sharing how to do that.

**1. You will be provided a button like below. Click it.**

<a class="rn-button btn-purple" href="https://githubtools.reppedintech.com/u/codetracker-learning/clone-me" target="_blank">COPY REPO</a>

**2. Authorize app**

On this initial time, you will need to authorize the application so that you can copy over the repo to your own Github profile. Scroll to the bottom of the popup window and Authorsize the application.

<div style="padding:119.14% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/694052966?h=92fda3bcc9&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="authorize"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

NOTE: You may have to login to GitHub

**3. Name the application**

You can keep the default or rename the application. If you already have a repo with the name, you will have to change it.

**4. Select "View on Github" and you will see your repo in your account.**

**5. Navigate to the directory that you want this repo to live on your local machine**

**6. Clone the repo using this command: `git clone {{CHANGE TO GITHUB SSH URL}}`**

**7. cd into the new directory that was created**

**8. run `code .` to view the code on your local machine**

**9. run `http-server -o` to test the code locally**

**10. YOU DID IT!**
