For this assignment, you will use the Goal Board template and fill it in prior to your first 1:1s with the instructional team.

In 1:1s, your instructor may tell you to add cards based on what they are seeing from you as well, but remember this is YOUR journey and you are responsible for all the planning and how you get there.

Your slides should have the following columns:

### About Me
**1. STRENGTHS: What I am good at that will help me achieve my goals**

What are you good at? What strengths do you have that are specific to helping you obtain the goal? These are here as reminders for the times when you are struggling, you can default back to your natural talents to help you.

**2. What is holding me back?**

Is there anything that is holding you back from obtaining your goals? If so, identify them here. Sometimes if these are too great, you may need to consider whether or not you can actually obtain the goal.

**3. Ultimate goals for this program**

For this column, we am only looking for frontend specific goals, but feel free to vision cast for the whole program. And, while getting a job can be in this column, that is not a specific goal. If you list large goals like that, also tell what you are going to do to get to this goal.


### My Goals -Tasks
**1. Need to do/Backlog**

These are things that you need to get to in order to meet your ultimate goals, but they are not your current focus. These are things you find along the way and you can make quick tickets to keep in this column and organize them based on priority.

**2. Current Focus**

These are the things you are currently focusing on. You should make measurable items so that you can ensure that you are focusing on things that will ultimately help you achieve the goal.

**3. Completed**

This is the column for all the cards, when done, to be put into so that you can see all your successes along the way. It is important that we plan our futures, but also stop to see how far we have come.
