## The Plan
**Description:** In this session, we will be working on creating a simple HTML/CSS website. The purpose of the walk through is to learn about semantic HTML and how to target classes for styling.

### Resources (For after the session):

- [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRJMOvaZuNeDB0M8l-8HZgrhqVl3y2j3W-kj4I_OgMYNuecotiNWJktv45dKbA03usI0FbFvaekEwIm/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000)
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/html-css-tj68ei?file=/readme.md)

**NOTE: This course is light on CSS and styling, so it is left up to you to take time to practice and work on your styling skills if that is of interest to you.**
