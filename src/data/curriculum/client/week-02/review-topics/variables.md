### What are Variables?
Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

3 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
- Using `var`
- Using `let`
- Using `const`

We will not be using var, but it is good to know that if you see it, it is declaring a variable.

### When to Use JavaScript let or const?
Always declare JavaScript variables with `let` or `const`.

The `let` keyword is used for variables that will be reassigned

The `const` keyword are for variables that cannot be reassigned.

### JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript **variables** must be **identified** with **unique names**.

These unique names are called **identifiers**.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter
- Names can also begin with `$` and `_`
- Names are case sensitive (`y` and `Y` are different variables)
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

**Note**
It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
