### Learning Objectives
- You should be able to remember the basic data types you will be working with in JavaScript.
- You should be able to describe the data type of different properties of real-world things that you represent in code.

### Describing Data
As a software developer, you will always be thinking about data - the type of your data, the structure of your data, the format of your data, and how to display your data to humans in a Web browser. In the beginning of the course, here are the basic data types you will be working with.

### Strings
You will use strings to represent words to be stored in your applications. A string is surrounded by double-quotes.

```js
const firstName = "Beyonce"
const lastName = "Knowles-Carter"
```

### Numbers
If you store a person's age, or a measurement, or a count of something, you will store it as a number. There are two types of numbers.

#### Integers
These are whole numbers: `1`, `3`, `45`, `1024`
```js
const applesInTheBasket = 16
```

#### Floats
Any fraction represented in decimal format: `1.333`, `2.414`, `3.14159`, `86.75`, `309.1`
```js
const pi = 3.14159
```
### Booleans
The logical values of `true` and `false`. You will use these values as you might expect in your applications. For example, if you want to track if a user account is currently active or not, you can use `true` if the account is active, or `false` if it is inactive.

```js
const accountIsActive = true;
```

Notice, there are not any quotes around `true` or `false`
