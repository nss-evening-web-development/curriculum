**Description:** If you are on social media, specifically those that do not allow links in posts like Instagram, you often see folks write "Link in Bio."

If you click on some influencer links from their bios, you will notice they have these cool landing pages that list out links, some have videos, etc.

Those are simply web pages that have been created on top of apps. While we have not gotten deep into app development yet, we can set up some bare bones HTML, CSS, Bootstrap landing pages for ourselves so that we can join the "Link in Bio" crew, or at the very least add it to our portfolio.

In this lab, you will create a single landing page.

**The expectation is that you will complete this lab in class today.**

Here is an example:
