Similar to our first Team Assignment, you will be breaking up into groups to work through sharing your knowledge of the items we will look at today. You will have an hour to work through these and then we will come back as a class to talk through your questions and presentations.

Use the REVIEW Topic lessons and [this resource](https://www.javascript.com/learn/strings) to help you along the way.

The presentation should include the following slides:

(1) Variables

(2) Data Types
- Primitive Data Types

(3) Data Structures
- Arrays
- Objects

(4) Operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators 
- Logical operators

(5) Conditionals
- Falsey/Truthy Values
- Conditional Statements

(6) Questions Your Team Has
- A “Questions we still have” slide with all the questions your team wants to talk through. Please do not put Googleable questions on this slide. This slide should only include things that your team would like to understand better AFTER you have researched.
