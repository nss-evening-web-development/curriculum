## Part 1 - freeCodeCamp
Go through all of the lessons in the [debugging section on FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#debugging). If you have already done them, do them again as a refresher.

## Part 2 - Using the Debugger
As a software developer, the developer tools in the browser are where you will spend about 75% of your time and focus. Being comfortable with the debugger and stepping through your code one line at a time to see what's happening is a crucial, core skill for a junior developer.

By the end of the client side course, you are expected to be proficient in the use of your developer tools.

"But they are scary, I want to avoid them."

That's not a Growth Mindset. That is your Fixed Mindset talking. Professional software developers have a Growth Mindset and strategically use their time to get better at the skills needed to be successful.

_❗ Debugging and the developer tools is how you gather evidence. Professional developers use evidence, at all times, when examining issues with their code. They never guess or assume what the problem is._
