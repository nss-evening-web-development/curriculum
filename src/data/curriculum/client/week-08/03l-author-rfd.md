In this lab, you are going to GET (READ), Filter, and DELETE Authors

- GET (READ)
  - All Authors (navigation)
- Filters
  - Favorite Authors (add a navigation item that when clicked, gets all the favorite authors and renders them to the DOM)
  - Modify the Author card to add an element that shows if an author is a favorite author (Take a look at the implementation on the Book card for on sale books)
- DELETE
  - Author (on card)
