In this lesson, we are going to be implementing the endpoints that we created in Postman in into our code.

We will be focusing on GET (READ), Filters, and DELETE.

- **GET (READ)**
  - All Books (navigation and on app load after login)
- **Filters**
  - Books on Sale (navigation)
- **DELETE**
  - Book (card)
- **GET (READ) - Merge Data**
  - Single Book (book card - when a user clicks the icon to view book, show the single book details along with the author details on the DOM)
