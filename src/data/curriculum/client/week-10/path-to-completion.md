### 1️⃣ Getting Started
1. Create Repo in GitHub from curriculum or template
1. Clone repo down
1. Complete all the items in the README for the template
1. npm start to make sure boilerplate code loads on DOM

### 2️⃣ Setup Persistent Data Storage
1. Create [Firebase app](https://nss-evening-curriculum.netlify.app/client/firebase-setup) (COMPLETE ALL 7 REQUIRED STEPS)
1. Set up authentication (login/signup/sign out)
1. Deploy application on Netlify (Update readme with link)

### 3️⃣ Planning (Time box this to no more than 4 hours)
1. Type out all the features the application needs in an instructions readme and order them by priority
1. Create issue tickets for EVERY feature broken down into small parts
1. Using features, figure out what data needs to be saved in DB
1. Create ERD from list of data needed (Add to Readme)
1. Create wireframe from list of features (Add to readme)
1. Create Mock Data based on ERD and place in sample data directory in repo (you can use a tool like Mockaroo)
1. Upload mock JSON data to Firebase

### 4️⃣ Feature Development
Start on features one-by-one 

1. Create a branch for this feature
1. Code out the feature
    - Make sure container has all the data it needs (Make files and/or functions in helper folder for API calls)
    - Create components for things I think will be reusable or need a lot of logic. (If logic is reusable, move it to a function in the helper folder)
    - After every major change make a commit with a good description.
1. Update main readme with feature along with pictures
1. Push branch to GitHub after feature’s done
1. Create PR to check the code to make sure I’m pushing up the correct code
1. Merge it in
1. Check deployed app to make sure everything’s working as expected
1. Pull down new main
1. Repeat a-k

### 5️⃣ Finishing up
README is completed with:

- Name of the Project
- Overview of the project
- Link to your wireframes/prototype
- Link to the deployed project
- Link to your project board (yes...even though it is a part of the repo)
- Description of the user
- List of features
- Screenshots of your project
- List of contributors and links to their GH profiles
- Link to Loom video walkthrough of your app (no more than 1 minute long! Make it great)
