## Get Started
- Copy repo
- Clone repo
- Follow the instructions in the readme

## Rules
Everyone loves rules üôÑ. So, these are not hard rules, but just some things you need to consider:

**The goal of this project is to test your knowledge and to have a FUN time stretching yourself on your FIRST independent application that will become a part of your portfolio.**

**Focus on MVP (Minimum Viable Product).** 

_A minimum viable product (MVP) is a development technique in which a new product or website is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters. The final, complete set of features is only designed and developed after considering feedback from the product's initial users._

Do not spend a ton of time styling initially. Hit HTML and structure using bootstrap, then functionality first and then spend time on the styling of the project.

- READ THROUGH ALL OF THE INFORMATION BELOW before planning how you will tackle the project.
- PLEASE submit questions using the help tickets and post you have a ticket up **IN SLACK under the help thread** if you need help. We will prioritize helping students who complete Help tickets. **(Doing the research first is what Software Engineers do)**
- **_Do NOT_** copy/paste someone else's code especially if you do not understand it. It is OK to reference code, but change it up a bit. We should see different function names that YOU created.
- Once you hit MVP, everyone will present how far they got AND their favorite piece of code that they wrote to an instructor!
- MOST OF ALL HAVE FUN!!!!!

## Definition of Done
- All items are completed in getting started
- MVP, defined by the Acceptance Criteria, has been completed
- The title of your application is visible in the browser tab
- The project has been deployed
- Loom video has been created
- `README.md` has been updated

## FAQs
**Can I work with a teammate on the project?** 

You can definitely reach out for help from your teammates, but remember this is an individual project that measures **YOUR** skills, so allow your teammates time to work on their projects and do not monopolize their time. **DO NOT copy/paste a teammates code or implementation.** Do your own work and at the very least make sure code is not identical.

**Will I get in trouble if I do not finish the project?** 

NO! We are adults and "getting into trouble" is not something we aspire to even consider in our environment. This does not mean that you should not do your best to complete it. If you follow the student responsibilites you should be ok. If you do not follow these, you will be held accountable.

Student responsibilites include:
- completing Github discussion tickets when needing help
- working on the project during the 25 hours dedicated for learning time
- communicating any needs


**Why are we doing this?** 

Because this is training for your interviews and for you to get a good evaluation of what you know by working on a project. After every section of lessons, we will have an individual project to also prep you for your capstone. It is an important part of synthesizing what you are learning and putting it into practice.
