Learning software development isn't like learning anything else you have ever done...like EVER! So, we're not going to treat it like anything else. This is likely going to be a very different experience from your high school chemistry class or your college intro to philosophy.

To be successful in this space,
You must be curious.
You must be ok with being uncomfortable.
You must be ok with a serious amount of failing before succeeding.
You must ask questions.
Student Responsibilities

1. Owning your experience, which includes:
CAMERAS ON unless you have permission for that session. Permissions are PER SESSION and do not carry over unless explicitly discussed with your instructional team.
Showing up to class ON TIME
Participating in class discussions and group projects
Complete the exercises for each week and top it all off with a capstone project
Working outside of class on new concepts
2. Ask questions! Even if the question is a "huh, I don't know where to start," it is absolutely imperative that students take responsibility for their own understanding and clarify any questions right away.

3. Make sure you are putting in the time and effort to reach success.

Bottom Line: We will give you all of the ingredients, but it's up to you to bake the cake.

Why
First, and most importantly, in software development, each concept builds upon the previous concept, so general understanding of each concept is necessary before moving on. Second, teaching adults over the course of a year is a unique situation, and the adults we accept into the program are expected to have the work ethic needed to forge their own path.

After completing a lesson, you will need submit it. This is how we track your progress.

BY MARKING SOMETHING AS COMPLETE, YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT TOPIC.
