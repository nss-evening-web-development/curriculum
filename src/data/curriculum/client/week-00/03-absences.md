If you know ahead of time that you are going to be absent, send an email to: (DO NOT SEND SLACK MESSAGES!)
[attendance@nashvillesoftwareschool.com](mailto:attendance@nashvillesoftwareschool.com) and your senior instructor's email

Students are expected to notify the CEO and their instructor if they must miss a class session or need to leave class prior to the end of the class day. Instructors may, at their option, choose to grant students excused absence status for absences that are discussed in advance with the instructor.

Should absence be necessary, students are responsible for gathering course material and assignments covered during the time of absence from their classmates.

Attendance will be taken every day.

Part-time students in twelve (12) month courses: More than five excused absences, or two unexcused absences, within either half of the class, could be assigned a probationary status.

One more absence for a student already on probation may, at the discretion of the CEO, and after consultation with the instructor, result in the student either being asked to take a leave of absence from the program and re-enroll in a future offering of the class (in such a case the student’s tuition will be credited forward to the future re-enrollment) or dismissal from the program. The School must unofficially withdraw a student after five (5) consecutive class days of unapproved absence from all classes, unless extraordinary circumstances prevented the student from providing notification to NSS.
