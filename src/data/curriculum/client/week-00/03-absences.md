If you know ahead of time that you are going to be absent, send an email to: (DO NOT SEND SLACK MESSAGES!)
[attendance@nashvillesoftwareschool.com](mailto:attendance@nashvillesoftwareschool.com) and your senior instructor's email.

Students are expected to notify the NSS and their instructor if they must miss a class session or need to leave class prior to the end of the class day. Instructors may, at their option, choose to grant students excused absence status for absences that are discussed in advance with the instructor.

Should absence be necessary, students are responsible for gathering course material and assignments covered during the time of absence from their classmates.

Attendance will be taken every day.

Please refer to the student handbook for updates or more details on these policies. You should be able to access through your cohort google group.
