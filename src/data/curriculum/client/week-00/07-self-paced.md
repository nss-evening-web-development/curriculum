The pace of the course at NSS is primarily self-directed within a specific timeframe (usually a week). This allows you to interact with the content, but also provides guidelines so that you do not fall behind.

Students should make every effort to complete all required content each week.

## Lesson Priority
Each week, we provide a list of lessons, assignments, etc that use the following priority types: 

- 🔴 **REQUIRED** - You **MUST** complete this curriculum item
- 🟡 **RECOMMENDED** - While not required, it is highly recommended that you complete this curriculum item before the next group project
- 🟢 **OPTIONAL** - Lessons for students with faster processing speeds or to come back to

There will be times when you have extra time outside of the required 25 hours per week and it may be beneficial for you to deepen your knowledge with more content. 

For weeks when your time is limited, focus on mastering the 🔴 **REQUIRED** content

## Lesson Types
We also have several types of lessons that meet the needs of different types of learners and to ensure that you see the content multiple times. Here are the types of lessons we will conduct during your time at NSS:

- 👩🏽‍🏫 LIVE LEARNING SESSION: Live coding/learning sessions (no longer than an hour)
- ℹ️ INFO - Informational Content
- 🎥 VIDEO: Video content for students to review
- 💻 CODE ALONG: Video/Tutorials for students. These are NOT live sessions
- 🥼LAB - Assignments and lessons that happen and are completed during class time. Student working individually in groups to complete what was covered in the live coding session
- ↩️ REVIEW/NOTES - Info for students to review on own time
- 👥 STUDY GROUP - Assignments to be completed during study group.
- 📝 ASSIGNMENT - Student work done outside of class or during lab
