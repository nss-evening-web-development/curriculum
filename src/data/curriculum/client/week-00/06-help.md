It is expected that you will need help during your time here in the bootcamp. We have a very specific way for students to ask for a receive help that is CRUCIAL for your success as a future Software Engineer because it is the process we follow in the field.

Click this [link](https://github.com/orgs/nss-evening-web-development/discussions) to see the Github Discussions. If you cannot access, let your instructor know.

### Who answers calls for help?
Short answer: we all do!

If you are able to help a classmate, please do so. Otherwise, instructors will jump in during class time to help those who have submitted help tickets. We may also answer outside of class, but this is not expected.

Help tickets have 1st priority and are answered in the order they are received if another classmate is not able to help. So, when you need help, make sure to submit one.

_Do NOT post requests for code related help in the slack channel. All requests need to come through the help space._

RULES:
You have to answer ALL of the questions below to use the Help Discussion:
1. Search the other help posts. Do that first!
1. If there are similar issues, make sure to give us the link in your post and tell how yours is different
1. Give your post a descriptive title
1. Describe your issue
1. List any error messages that appear
1. What have you researched? (Paste links to the things you have found from your google search - You must include at least 3 links)
1. What have you tried? Tell us everything you have tried.
1. Copy/paste link TO THE FILE on your branch or in your repo that you are having issues with NO SCREEN SHOTS 🥰

NOTE: We will not accept links to the whole repo. You must provide a link directly to the specific file

ONCE YOU GET AN ANSWER: Add a comment to your discussion if the answer is not already present and mark it as the answer.

Once you get a resolution either through the discussion or outside of it, you must update with the answer you used to solve your issue.
