You should expect to come to class on time and stay the entire time. On weekdays, we have breaks when necessary, but it is best if you come to class having eaten and are ready to go. 

On Saturdays, you can plan for a 20-minute meal break between 11:30AM - 12:30PM depending on what we are working on and a couple of breaks.

- Saturday (Class) - 9:00AM - 2:00PM (5 hours)
- Monday (Class) - 6:00PM - 9:30 PM (3.5 hours)
- Tuesday (Class) - 6:00PM - 9:30 PM (3.5 hours)
- Wednesday or Thursday (Study Group) - (3-hours: your group can decide on time)

Every week you will have lessons, quizzes, study groups, etc. that you are responsible for completing before class.

It is expected that you will complete all work for each week before the Saturday class as we will build on those concepts.

Total Time Commitment: ~ 25 hours per week
- 15-hours team learning
- 6-10 hours self-guided learning
