Welcome to the curriculum, which includes assignments, study group projects and assessments.

## Completing Assignments and Coursework
It is important that each student works through the content of the course based on the schedule we provided in the last section.
After completing an assignment, you will need to submit the assignment.

Submitting the assignments means that you completed all the work (assignments may take longer, so make sure to give yourself time), that you are prepared to participate in class, and that you do not have any questions about the content.

If you have questions, put them in the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/nss-evening-web-development/discussions) for your peers and instructors to help.

## Everything Builds While You Learn to Build
Every concept you learn will be used in the next week and the next and will continue to build. This is important to note because this is not like traditional school where when you have completed an assignment or test, you move on.

It is **ESSENTIAL** that you ask questions, seek to understand and push yourself, but also note that you don't have to learn everything at once. We will be using concepts over and over again until they become muscle memory.

Don't try and cram everything. Do the lessons and assignments and then move forward.

## How this is going to work
You will access this course throughout your time in the FE class. It will help guide you on what you should be doing and how far you have gone in the course. This information will also be used by the instructors to ensure that you are on track and doing the work necessary to be successful.

The purpose of this format is to let you know what is coming and how you can prepare to use your time wisely.

The bootcamp experience is **NOT** an asynchronous online format, as such this course format supports the hybrid nature of virtual learning while also ensuring we are all aware of what we are learning and when.

Some weeks will only include your assignments because we may review in class, so know that while in the beginning, there may be more info as you become more acclimated to the learning environment, the course will help you keep track of assignments and projects that are scheduled for each week.
