**_See the react-topics project for code samples_**

- Pages
  - In the react-topics project, navigate to the pages directory, create a new file named the path.(e.g. contact.js)
  - Navigate to that page in the address bar. (e.g. http://localhost:3000/contact.js)
  - You may have nested routes by creating directories/folders (see code example: my-folder)
- Dynamic Routes
  - Are determined by naming a file with square brackets and then the name of the dynamic key between: `[dynamicKey].js`
  - The filename **MUST** have square brackets if the page is using a dynamic route
  - You can only have one dynamic file per directory
