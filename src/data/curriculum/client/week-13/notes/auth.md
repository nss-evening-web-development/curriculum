This lesson is informational and not intended for you to complete anything.

Authentication is already set up for you in the template you will use when you build your projects. All you will need to do is the following when the time comes:

1. Create your Firebase project as before
2. Add your Firebase credentials to your .env file

Once you do these things, you will have access to user info and they will only be able to access pages in the app if they are logged in.

There are a couple of pieces of code that is handling this, which is broiler plate for you, but if you are interested in learning more AFTER you have picked up the basic concepts of React, let an instructor know and we can set up a session to walk through it.
