## The Plan

**Description:** Welcome to your introduction to JS Libraries! We’re diving into React using Next.js, a powerful React framework that will make your learning journey smoother.

**Q:** Why are we using Next.js instead of just plain React?

**A:** Next.js IS React, but with added features that simplify your learning experience, allowing you to focus on mastering React without getting bogged down by extra libraries.

Over the next few weeks, you'll get comfortable with React, gearing up to build your capstone project with confidence.

## Get Started

- Follow the tutorial **(details below)**

As engineers, our first step when learning new tech is to dive into the documentation. That’s exactly what you’ll do as you get hands-on with Next.js using the App Router, a modern approach that enhances routing and component organization in your React apps. Bookmark these two essential sites for your journey:

- <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React JS</a>
- <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages" target="_blank">Next JS</a>

Don’t stress! Everything you've learned so far is still valuable and will serve as a solid foundation for this next step. 

Some concepts might feel unfamiliar, but remember: the unfamiliar became routine when you first tackled promises, and now you’re calling APIs like a pro! Let’s take on this new challenge with the same energy.

### **Review the Next.js Documentation:**

Focus on the following topics, specifically using the App Router to take advantage of Next.js’s latest capabilities:

**FOUNDATIONS**

- <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/what-is-react-and-nextjs" target="_blank">About React and Next.js - Chapters 1 - 8 are mandatory.</a>

As you go through these chapters, answer the following questions to deepen your understanding. Collaborate with your teammates, research, or find creative ways to get the answers.

10. On a scale of 1-5, how do you feel about each area you should be familiar with?
11. What can you do to increase your competency in each area?
12. What are the 3 core concepts of React?
13. What is a component?
14. What are props?
