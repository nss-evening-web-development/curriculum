## The Plan
**Description:** As we move into JS Libraries, we will be leveraging Next.js, which is a React framework to learn React.

**Q:** Why are we using Next.js and not just plain React?

**A:** Next.js IS React, but with a few nicer tools that will help us to focus on learning react and not on 3rd party libraries.

We will structure the next several weeks for you to become comfortable with React so that you can build your capstone using it.

## Get Started:
- Follow the tutorial **(details below)**

For this class session, we want you to focus on getting back into the swing of things and getting comfortable with technical documentation.

As a software engineer, it is important that when learning new technologies, you familiarize yourself with the documentation associated with it. Since we will be learning React via a React framework called Next.js, you will likely want to bookmark two sites:

- <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React JS</a>
- <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started" target="_blank">Next JS</a>

Now, don‚Äôt get worried! Everything you have learned up until this point is still important and will be valuable as you will see in the following exercise.

Some things will be new and may seem foreign, but weren‚Äôt promises foreign when you first encountered them? They may not be second nature yet, but you are using them to make calls to APIs, which is something you did not know how to do 3 months ago.

For the set of questions below, you will review the Next JS documentation. More specifically, you will review the following topics:

**FOUNDATIONS**

- <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs" target="_blank">About Next.js</a>
- <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/from-javascript-to-react" target="_blank">From JavaScript to React</a>
- <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/from-react-to-nextjs" target="_blank">From React to Next.js</a>
- <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works" target="_blank">(OPTIONAL) How Next.js Works</a>

While you are reviewing these, answer these questions below to the best of your ability.

**_How you get the answers is totally up to you. You can research, work with teammates, etc._**

- Why do you think we are learning React?
- What are you most excited about?
- What are you most fearful about?
- What are the things you need to consider when building modern web applications?
- Why? Explain in your own words.
- Draw a diagram/image that visualizes the building blocks of a web application.
- What is the difference between imperative and declarative programming?
- Which type of programming library is react?
- What JS topics should you be familiar with?
- On a scale of 1-5 how do you feel about each area that you should be familiar with?
- What can you do to increase your competency in each area?
- What are the 3 core concepts of react?
- What is a component?
- What are props?
- What is state?
- What more can you learn about these concepts?
